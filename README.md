## Project Overview
This project explore the advantages and disadvantages of convolutional 
neural network in the task of facial recognition, or computer vision
in general. 

---

## Prerequisite
This project was build with Anaconda dedicated Python 
virtual environment, follow the offficial Anaconda website 
for instruction to install and set up the Anaconda 
environment 
https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/getting-started

## How to Run the Project
Follow these instructions to compile and run the project:

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```Anaconda Prompt
   git clone https://git.txstate.edu/qfc2/Facial-Recognition-Machine-Learning
   cd path/to/your/cloned-repo
   ```
2. **Install the Necessary Packages**:  
   ```Anaconda Prompt
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Start the Jupyter Notebook Session**
   ```Anaconda Prompt
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Additional Information
In the source code, much of the folders/files path needed to load necessary images data,
models, and training weights, thus they need to be change to the proper path before re-running 
programs.
